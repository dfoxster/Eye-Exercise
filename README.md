# Eyes Exercise

## Overview

This project showcases the use of Javascript to manipulate HTML DOM elements.  A Javascript function is added to the proper event to provide the desired result.

## How To Run
1.  Once the page loads, use the mouse to move the cursor around the page.  An onmouseevent event listener is added that will cause the eye balls to mimic the movement of the cursor within the eye sockets.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add an Eye Color dropdown list that will change the eye ball color to the selected color.
- [ ] Add Blink control that will simulate the blinking of the eyes.  Where a pane that matches the background color of the page will move from the top of the eye sockets down, then up at regular time intervals
- [ ] Add a Lazy Eye control that provides the ability to stop movement in one eye (left of right at the choce of the user).
